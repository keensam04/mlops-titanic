# Titanic dataset

This dataset is published as a part of the legendary [Titanic ML competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

Using the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.

Check out the ["Data" tab on the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) to explore the datasets even further.
